Hi, my name is Lucy Haskew. I am a passionate developer specializing in automation, data processing, and optimization. Currently, I automate fitment processes for a leading multimillion-dollar corporation, where I design and implement custom algorithms and systems to streamline operations and improve efficiency.

Alongside my professional work, I take on side projects that challenge my skills and push me to learn and grow. One of my current projects is rebuilding a website for a long-established business, where Iâ€™m handling everything from design to implementation.
