Hi, my name is Lucy Haskew. I am a passionate developer specializing in automation, data processing, and optimization. Currently, I automate fitment processes for a leading multimillion-dollar corporation, where I design and implement custom algorithms and systems to streamline operations and improve efficiency. My work helps reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and integrate new product lines seamlessly, leading to significant cost savings and enhanced customer satisfaction.

Alongside my professional work, I take on side projects that challenge my skills and push me to learn and grow. One of my current projects is rebuilding a website for a long-established business, where Iâ€™m handling everything from design to implementation. This involves creating a user-friendly, modern interface that reflects the business's legacy while integrating new features to enhance their digital presence.
